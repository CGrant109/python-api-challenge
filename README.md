## Python-Api-Challenge:
## A Deep-Dive on Varying Weather Among Cities World-Wide Using Pandas and Api's

Finding temperatures, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed among cities.

## Methods Used  

Dataframes, scatter plots, heatmaps, and linear regression


## Technologies

Jupyter notebook, Pandas, MatPlotLib.pyplot, scipy.stats, numpy, json, time, requests


## Data Source

Data found in python-api-challenge/WeatherPY/data/cities.csv

## Installation

Code was tested using Jupyter notebook.  The environment also needs the ##Technologies listed above. The environment was setup as follows:

```bash
source activate PythonData38
jupyter notebook
```

## Additional Analysis

#1. Evidenced by the humidity heatmap, areas in Mexico, Cuba, and Puerto Rico have similar levels of humdity compared to HI, and areas of the west/east coast of the US.



#2. Based on Latitude vs Temperature Plot, we can infer that the max temperature goes down significantly as we move higher in latitude inbetween 30 and 60 latitude in particular. This is especially true when witnessing the Nothern Hemisphere in Max Temp vs Latitude Linear Regression.



#3. Evidenced by the Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression, we can see that as we move higher in latitude, the cloudiness of cities observed in these areas have higher levels of cloudiness.



#4. After graduating this bootcamp, I need to plan a vacation somewhere warm.
